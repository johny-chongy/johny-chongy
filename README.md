* 👋 Hello there! I'm John Chong and located in the Bay Area.
* 🌱 I just finished my fullstack coding bootcamp at Rithm School with hopes to join the tech workforce soon.
* ⚙️ I’m currently working on a web application that can hopefully help me draft better in my next nba fantasy season.
* 🤜🤛 I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects, and open to working either remote or in person as a software engineer. I can also consider taking on contracts.
* 📫 Feel free to reach me @ johnchong.99.17@gmail.com
